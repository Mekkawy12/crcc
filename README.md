# CRCC Container Runtime Compliance Checker

This app maybe overengineered (definitely it is) in terms of the technologies that I am using but this not meant to be a production app.
this app is the backend side for my CCC (Container Compliance Checker).

This is an exhaustive list for the technologies that I used in this app:
1. Go (A trendy Programming Language)
2. PostgreSQL
3. Nginx (web server as a proxy)
4. [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) the project structure we follow
5. NuxtJs framework with Aragon theme [live preview](https://nuxt-argon-dashboard-laravel.creative-tim.com/dashboard/).
6. Json and [Json:api](https://jsonapi.org/) a standard for sending and receiving json structure
7. Docker & Docker compose for containers management.

[comment]: <> (8. gRPC a framework for implementing RPC APIs via HTTP/2 &#40;Not yet&#41;)
