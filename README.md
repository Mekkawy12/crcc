# CRCC Container Runtime Compliance Checker

This app maybe overengineered (definitely it is) in terms of the technologies that I am using but this not meant to be a production app.
this app is the backend side for my CCC (Container Compliance Checker).

This is an exhaustive list for the technologies that I used in this app:
1. Go (A trendy Programming Language)
2. PostgreSQL
3. Nginx (web server as a proxy)
4. [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) the project structure we follow
5. Docker & Docker compose
6. gRPC a framework for implementing RPC APIs via HTTP/2 (Not yet)


## To Run the app
-  copy `config.yml.example` to `config.yml` .
-  `docker-compose up` you may need `sudo` .
